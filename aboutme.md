<p align="center"><strong> Making sense out of the world using data. Part time student, full time mom. </strong></p>


<h3> My Journey Begins </h3>

<p> Hello, and welcome to my magical data driven journey. I am switching gears and looking to dive into a new career of data science. So come along and enjoy the scenery as I learn and work on many new projects. </p>

<h3> Life Experience </h3>

<p> I Have spend much of my working life doing jobs to help people understand and learn different concepts and ideas. I have worked as a teacher for about nine years and in accounting for about 3 years. Currently, I am homeschooling my son and have been doing so for the past 8 years. I have always enjoyed working with people but data has always been a passion and I am finally finding my way to a data driven profession. </p>

<h3> Life Learning </h3>

<p> I completed a Bachelor's of Business Adminstration in Accounting and then a Masters of Science in Elementary Education. Currently, I am attending Lambda School on the Data Science track and that has helped me prepare for a different type of role than I am used to but am excited to get started in. I am also learning more practical applications of data science and the respective tools used by data scientists to enrich business decisions. I look forward to working along other data professionals in driving business initiatives that help make the world a better place.</p>
